Simulation of water bottle rocket physics as ODEs

This model was created as part of the final portion of ME495 W15. It has two sets of files. 
The launch validation files (launch_val.m and valfun.m) were used to refine the launch part of the model using sample data.
The simulation files (model_sim.m and modelfun.m) were used to simulate the flight of the rocket from launch to landing.
